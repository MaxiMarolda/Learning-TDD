# Learning-TDD
Practicing how to implement TDD in my projects
The purpose of this project is to practice and improve my coding skills by implementing TDD Test Driven Development.
During my recent experience at Henry we covered testing but there was so much to learn that we couldn't deeply get into testing,
so this is the perfect oportunity to do so by no only practicing testing, but also implementing it as a way of implementing it 
as a best practice in order to produce better software.
